**TEST_with_net_science_full_targets_terminal**

This is a very indicative list of lectures and practicals.

Describe why networks: from social to spatial.

1.  [Cities, a very very brief introduction](src/why_cities.qmd)

    -   **ADD UNIT INFO**

2.  [Smart cities, urban big data, digital twins and other buzz terms](src/smart_cities.qmd)

    -   Practical: [APIs and urban data](src/apis.Rmd) 
    
    <!-- 2. digital traces **P**: ??? think of traces --> 
    
    <!-- 3. Social Media **P**: Twitter -->

3.  Lecture on networks **L** *done*

4.  Network analysis practical 1

5.  Network analysis practical 2

    -   Cs√°rdi, G., Nepusz, T., & Airoldi, E. M. (2016). Statistical network analysis with igraph. Springer. Available online at https://www.uni-due.de/hummell/sna/igraph/docs/.BookDraft-CsardiNepuszAiroldi2016.pdf. \[*methods*\]

    -   Degree distribution (see help_degree_sistribution.Rmd)

6.  Network science, urban laws and scaling **L** *done*

    -   Build and compare models**P** *done*, *decide if I need to describe sample\_* syntax

Network modelling??? *NO* - @light2020oxford, Ch. 12-15 - @kolaczyk2020statistical Ch 6 - ERGM and other - link prediction 7 - https://statnet.org/

Economic complexity??

7.  Lecture on transport geography.

For spatial interactions: - Bettencourt 2021 8.1.3 for Maximum entropym radiation and a variant of urban scaling - https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10856

For network analysis: - Barthelemy 2018 Ch. 7. It has examples for road and subway studies + some policy elements. No code.

8.  Networks small scale / Spatial networks

    -   https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sfnetworks/
    -   Boeing
    -   https://osf.io/78yub/
    -   Lovelace's book, Geocomputation with R https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/

use sfnetworks as it contains igraph. Use the vignettes. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sfnetworks/index.html

9.  Practical on spatial interaction modelling @kolaczyk2020statistical Ch 9

10. Urban policies and causality
