## Regression assumptions

1) **Linearity** - The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.

2) **Homoscedasticity** - The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.

3) **Independence** - Observations are independent of each other

## Demonstration



## Transport geography: quantitative dimension

 - Why transport in this module?
 
  1. Fundamental for social and economic activities
  
  2. All about networks & interactions
  

<!-- -   Empirical data

-   Data analytics

-   Applied science: improve the efficiency of movements / spatial constraints

-   Why in this unit? -->

## Transport geography: key elements

-   Distance

-   Accessibility: the capacity of a location to be reached by, or to reach different locations

-   Spatial interaction: movement of people, freight or information between an origin and destination

-   Transportation and land use models

Terminology

- terminal = node = vertex

- link = edge

- Sub-graph - Loop (buckle)

More types of graphs

-   Planar graph vs Non-planar graph

-   Cycle, circuit

<!--

-   Abstraction

-   Represent the structure not the appearance

<!--
## Graph theory, aka network analysis-->

## Plannar graph analysis

-   Proportion between nodes and edges: $\beta = e / v$, where $e$ is the number of links & $v$ the number of nodes

-   Network density:  $Gamma$ AKA (number of liks / maximum number of links)

    -   planar: $\gamma = \frac{e}{3(v-2)}$

    -   non-planar: $\gamma = \frac{2e}{v(v-1)}$
    
- Structure vs Topology 

<!--## Graph theory, aka network analysis -->

## Plannar graph analysis

-   Degree centrality, Betweenness, Eigenvector centrality,...

-   Eccentricity: the distance from a given node to the farthest node from it in the network

-   Shimbel index, or nodal accessibility, or Fareness (see [Lecture 3](https://etranos.info/urban_analytics_city_science/src/intro_networks.html#/title-slide){target="_blank"}

    -   $c_ùëñ= \sum_j d_{ij}$

    -   This is a purely topological accessibility metric, remember this for later.

## Graph analysis

Closeness centrality (from Lecture 3)

-   Which node has the shortest distance to other nodes

-   Instead of focusing on the number of links, the focus turns to the network distances

-   Different definitions:

-   Closeness, $c_{i} = 1/\sum_{j} d_{ij}$

-   Fareness, $c_{i} = \sum_{j} d_{ij}$

-   `igraph` calculates closeness

## Graph analysis

**The Gini coefficient**

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Measure of dispersion often used as Inequality measure

    -   0: perfect equality
    -   1 :perfect inequality

-   Ordered X and Y, cumulative percentage

-   Mostly used for income inequalities, but can be more widely used

-   $Gini = A / (A + B)$

Example: measuring traffic concentration

Temporal variations of the Gini coefficient reflect changes in the comparative advantages of a location within the transport system


<!--## The Location Quotient Coefficient

-   Degree of concentration of a certain activities

-   Very common for regional analysis too

-   $M_{ti}$ is the traffic of a merchandise $t$ at a terminal $i$

-   $Mi$ is the traffic of all merchandise at a terminal $i$

-   $M_{t}$ is the total of all merchandises of type $t$ for all terminals, and

-   $M$ is the total of all types of merchandises for all terminals

 ## The Location Quotient Coefficient

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
<br> <br> <br>

$LQ = \frac{\frac{M_{it}}{M_i}}{\frac{M_t}{M}}$
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   $LQ <1$: traffic of merchandise $t$ in terminal $i$ is under-represented compared to the same merchandise in all terminals

-   $LQ = 1$ traffic of merchandise $t$ in terminal $i$ is proportional to its participation to total traffic

-   $LQ > 1$ traffic of merchandise $t$ in a terminal $i$ is preponderant in total traffic.

## Spatial interactions and the gravity model

-   A spatial interaction is a realised movement of people, goods or information between an origin and a destination

-   It is a transport demand/supply relationship expressed over geographical space.

## Spatial interactions and the gravity model

$T_{ij} = f(V_i, W_j, S_{ij})$

-   Flows are a function of the attributes of the locations of origin, the attributes of the locations of destination and the friction of distance between the concerned origins and the destinations

-   $T_{ij}$: Interaction between location $i$ (origin) and location $j$ (destination)

-   $V_i$: Attributes of the location of origin $i$ (e.g. population, number of jobs available, industrial output, GDP); push factors; the potential of origins

## Spatial interactions and the gravity model

$T_{ij} = f(V_i, W_j, S_{ij})$

-   $W_j$: Attributes of the location of destination $j$, pull factors; attractiveness of destinations

-   $S_{ij}$: Attributes of separation between $i$ and $j$ (e.g. distance, transport costs, or travel time); cost of overcoming the separation between origins and destinations

## Spatial interactions and the gravity model

$T_{ij} = k\frac{V_i^\lambda W_j^\alpha}{d_{ij}^\beta}$

-   $\beta$: transport friction parameter

-   $\lambda$: Potential to generate movements

-   $\alpha$: Potential to attract movements

# What can we do with this?

## 1. Calculate flows (naive)

$T_{ij} = k\frac{V_i^\lambda W_j^\alpha}{d_{ij}^\beta}$

-   Known: $V$, $W$, and $d$

-   Define: $\lambda=1$, $\alpha=1$, $\beta=2$, and $k=0.00001$

-   These are some standard results from past empirical studies

-   Big unknown: $T$

-   Example from @tranos2015international

## 1. Calculate flows (naive)

![](images/sim_calc.png)

## 1. Calculate flows (naive)

-   Fairly good estimation of reality for such an oversimplified model, but...

-   ... not good enough.

## 2. Estimate $\lambda$, $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $k$

-   Known: $T$, $V$, $W$, $d$ and $k$

-   Estiamte: $\lambda=1$, $\alpha=1$, and $\beta=2$

-   *Why?* To understand the effect of distance, pull and push factors

-   How? Regression

## 2. Estimate $\lambda$, $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $k$

::: incremental
-   $T_{ij} = k\frac{V_i^\lambda W_j^\alpha}{d_{ij}^\beta}$

-   Look up properties of logarithms, e.g. [here](http://dl.uncw.edu/digilib/Mathematics/Algebra/mat111hb/EandL/logprop/logprop.html)

-   $T_{ij} = kV_i^\lambda W_j^\alpha d_{ij}^{-\beta}$

-   $ln T_{ij} = ln (kV_i^\lambda W_j^\alpha d_{ij}^{-\beta})$

-   $ln T_{ij} = lnk + lnV_i^\lambda + ln W_j^\alpha + lnd_{ij}^{-\beta}$

-   $\color{red}{ln T_{ij}} = \color{blue}{lnk} + \lambda \color{green}{lnV_i} + \alpha \color{orange}{ln W_j} -\beta \color{purple}{lnd_{ij}}$

-   $\color{red}{y} = \color{blue}{c} + \lambda \color{green}{x_1} + \alpha \color{orange}{x_2} + \beta \color{purple}{x_3}$

-   Multivariate linear regression

## 2. Estimate $\lambda$, $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $k$

<center>![](images/sim_regression.png){width="55%"}</center>

## 2. Estimate $\lambda$, $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $k$

-   $c = lnk = 13.84$

-   $\lambda = lnV_i = 0.727$

-   $\alpha = lnW_j = 0.464$

-   $\beta = lnd_{ij} = -0.624$

-   What did we learn?

-   How can we use these coefficients

## 3. Estimate accessibility indicators

-   The potential of opportunities for interaction

-   Ease of spatial interaction

-   Attractiveness of a node in a network taking into account the mass of other nodes and the costs to reach those nodes via the network

## 3. Estimate accessibility indicators

Different typologies [@HOLL2007286]

1.  Network access

    -   distance to access the network

    -   travel opportunities

2.  Travel cost measures

    -   network access + distance/time travelled on the network

3.  Market potential accessibility

    -   destinations at greater distance provide diminishing opportunities
