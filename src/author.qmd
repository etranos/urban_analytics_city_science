I am a Professor of Quantitative Human Geography at the University of Bristol and a Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute. My research has been exposing the spatial dimensions of digital technologies and the digital economy from their early stages until today. I have published on issues related to the geography of the internet infrastructure, the economic impacts that such digital infrastructure can generate on cities and regions and the position of cities within spatial, complex networks. I have a strong interest and expertise on the use of new sources of big data, such as data from mobile phone operators, to better understand the complexities of smart cities and urban systems. Using such data and relevant computational methods, my research has explored the interplay between geography, spatial structure and social networks and how these support knowledge transfer and creation. Together with my team, we have explored how access to digital tools can intervene with some key dimensions of spatial structure including commuting and the role of distance.

Recently, we have been exploring the geography and the evolution of the creation of online content and its interrelation with cities and spatial structure using web data and digital archives. Our research framework enables us to access how early engagement with digital technologies may intervene with future regional productivity pathways.
