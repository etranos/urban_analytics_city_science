1.  [Cities, a very very brief introduction](why_cities.qmd){target="_blank"}

    Why do cities exist? One cannot study, analyse and model cities and systems of cities unless they know their fundamental attributes, and the reasons why cities have been developed at the first instance.

2.  [Smart cities, urban big data, digital twins and other buzz terms](smart_cities.qmd){target="_blank"}

    -   Practical: [APIs and urban data](apis.Rmd){target="_blank"}

    <!-- 2. digital traces **P**: ??? think of traces -->

    <!-- 3. Social Media **P**: Twitter -->

    How do digital technologies change cities? How does their usage actually enables citizens to act as sensors? And, how do these changes affect urban research? We will first approach these issues from a theoretical perspective and then utilise such free and open urban data using APIs.

3.  [Networks: an introduction](intro_networks.qmd){target="_blank"}

    Networks are everywhere! After this lecture you will hopefully start seeing them.

4.  [Network analysis practical: networks of cities](network_analysis.Rmd){target="_blank"}

5.  [Street network analysis practical: networks within cities](street_networks.Rmd){target="_blank"}

    These two practical sessions will put into practise your newly acquired network understanding of cities.

6.  [Network science, urban laws and scaling](network_science.qmd){target="_blank"}

    -   Practical: [Build and compare models](network_models.Rmd){target="_blank"}

    Moving from network analysis to network science with clear urban applications.
    
7.  Reading week 

8.  [Methods in transport geography](transport_geography.qmd){target="_blank"}

    Same methods, different facets of urban research. This part of the unit will allow you to apply your network skills to answer transport related questions. It will also make the transition from networks to flows.

9.  [Spatial interaction modelling](sim.Rmd){target="_blank"}

    You ve'learned how to analyse networks, now you can learn how to analyse and 
    model flows. Do you see the parallel?

10.  [Accessibility](accessibility_full.Rmd){target="_blank"}


11.  [Diversity in cities](diversity.qmd){target="_blank"}

      Why is diversity important in cities and how do we measure it?

12. [Urban policies and causality](Urban_policy___causal_design.pdf){target="_blank"}

    From urban analysis to urban policies. And how to assess such policies. An introduction to causality.
