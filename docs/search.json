According to AWS (2022):\n\nIn the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses. Their API documentation contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses.\n\nThe client’s software (this might be R for example) sends a request to the server requesting specific data. The response is the data the client asked.\nMore commonly, the client might be a mobile phone app (e.g. train network status app) and the server is the network operator’s server.\nAPIs can be private or public types.

See [here])(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) for more info] table in a .csv format, most APIs will ship data to you in a JSON format.\nAccording to the official JSON website (JSON), JSON\n\nis a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.\n\nIt adopts a hierarchical structure such as attribute:value instead of the fixed structure of tidy data. Following Singleton, Spielman, and Folch (2017), such attribute:value pairs might be:\n\n“mean income”:“50000”\n“internet speed”:“35”\n“jobs”:“15000”\n\nThese attributes might be organised hierarchically:\n(“city”:“Bristol,”mean income”: “27000”, “internet speed”: “55”, “jobs”:(“2019”:“15000”, “2020”:“14000”)), (“city”:“Newcastle,”mean income”: “25000”, “internet speed”: “45”, “jobs”:(“2019”:“11000”, “2020”:“10000”))\nAlthough this format is more verbose (attribute names are repeated) it is more flexible (not all observations need to have all attributes) (Singleton, Spielman, and Folch 2017)"

    "section": "Practical example with API",
    "text": "Practical example with API\nopendata.bristol.gov.uk offers a lot of data about Bristol. For this example, let’s try to work with Jobs by Ward (by industry) in Bristol 2020. As you can see, this is a small data set with \\(35\\) observations representing Bristol’s \\(35\\) Wards. You can visualise these data with the Table tab and even download a .csv with these data. To begin with, do both of these things.\nThen, go to the API tab. Change the rows you want to include in you API request from 10, which is the default here to 35, which is the maximum as we already know. Then clink on the Submit button and below that you will see a new link. This URL is your API request. If you carefully read the URL from right to left you can easily recognise the fields you saw on the previous screen. The weird output on your screen is the data you requested in JSON format.\n\n\n\nQuestion: Why should you go through all these efforts to build an API request and download the data in JSON file format instead of just downloading a .csv file?\n\n\n\nSo, let’s try to access these data programmatically. First, we need to load the relevant R packages\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'tidyverse' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\n-- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.2 --\nv ggplot2 3.3.6     v purrr   0.3.4\nv tibble  3.1.8     v dplyr   1.0.9\nv tidyr   1.2.0     v stringr 1.4.0\nv readr   2.1.2     v forcats 0.5.1\n\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'tibble' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'readr' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\n-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --\nx dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nx dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nWarning: package 'jsonlite' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'jsonlite'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    flatten\n\n\nTo access the data, we are going to use the function fromJSON() from the jsonlite package. Please check the syntax of this function as well as the other function of this package.\n\ndat <- jsonlite::fromJSON(\"https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/api/records/1.0/search/?dataset=jobs-by-ward-by-industry-in-bristol-2020&q=&rows=35&facet=ward\", flatten = TRUE)\n\nWe now have an R object called dat. Let’s try to see how it looks like\n\ntypeof(dat)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nSo, this is a list. If you need a reminder for what a list is, see here. Now the difficult part. Let’s try to figure out the structure of this JSON formated data.\n\nstr(dat)\n\nList of 4\n $ nhits       : int 35\n $ parameters  :List of 6\n  ..$ dataset : chr \"jobs-by-ward-by-industry-in-bristol-2020\"\n  ..$ rows    : int 35\n  ..$ start   : int 0\n  ..$ facet   : chr \"ward\"\n  ..$ format  : chr \"json\"\n  ..$ timezone: chr \"UTC\"\n $ records     :'data.frame':   35 obs. of  24 variables:\n  ..$ datasetid                                          : chr [1:35] \"jobs-by-ward-by-industry-in-bristol-2020\" \"jobs-by-ward-by-industry-in-bristol-2020\" \"jobs-by-ward-by-industry-in-bristol-2020\" \"jobs-by-ward-by-industry-in-bristol-2020\" ...\n  ..$ recordid                                           : chr [1:35] \"8f1ee37587a2233922bfa38b048879368059502e\" \"464799297e1d1af8bb980450d062c7eedb787042\" \"4cf81b7e8c57fc61c73eb40c4d4556446d20896c\" \"e034ff06e7c7d67f6f716c41e8ccd940a36d41fd\" ...\n  ..$ record_timestamp                                   : chr [1:35] \"2021-12-22T11:29:00.712Z\" \"2021-12-22T11:29:00.712Z\" \"2021-12-22T11:29:00.712Z\" \"2021-12-22T11:29:00.712Z\" ...\n  ..$ fields.mining_quarrying_utilities                  : int [1:35] 10 0 0 0 0 10 0 30 2250 0 ...\n  ..$ fields.transport_storage_inc_postal                : int [1:35] 20 0 350 15 200 50 100 600 1750 300 ...\n  ..$ fields.accommodation_food_services                 : int [1:35] 100 150 175 800 700 175 400 400 6000 300 ...\n  ..$ fields.public_administration_defence               : int [1:35] 0 0 0 10 50 0 0 400 9000 200 ...\n  ..$ fields.agriculture_forestry_fishing                : int [1:35] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n  ..$ fields.business_administration_support_services    : int [1:35] 125 75 1250 1750 450 225 500 450 11000 125 ...\n  ..$ fields.retail                                      : int [1:35] 700 100 200 700 900 75 800 1500 4500 500 ...\n  ..$ fields.property                                    : int [1:35] 10 15 20 450 175 75 200 30 1750 30 ...\n  ..$ fields.health                                      : int [1:35] 150 125 125 450 500 500 2000 900 12000 1500 ...\n  ..$ fields.motor_trades                                : int [1:35] 125 30 300 30 350 20 40 600 200 40 ...\n  ..$ fields.manufacturing                               : int [1:35] 150 25 900 25 400 5 75 500 500 50 ...\n  ..$ fields.information_communication                   : int [1:35] 225 200 400 800 350 175 450 700 10000 50 ...\n  ..$ fields.education                                   : int [1:35] 350 250 400 200 350 175 1000 500 9000 800 ...\n  ..$ fields.ward_code                                   : chr [1:35] \"E05010889\" \"E05010918\" \"E05010890\" \"E05010894\" ...\n  ..$ fields.financial_insurance                         : int [1:35] 1500 10 10 600 50 10 75 15 8000 35 ...\n  ..$ fields.ward                                        : chr [1:35] \"Bishopsworth\" \"Windmill Hill\" \"Brislington East\" \"Clifton Down\" ...\n  ..$ fields.period                                      : chr [1:35] \"2020\" \"2020\" \"2020\" \"2020\" ...\n  ..$ fields.professional_scientific_technical           : int [1:35] 75 125 200 1000 600 250 800 600 22000 125 ...\n  ..$ fields.construction                                : int [1:35] 500 125 500 300 400 100 350 175 1250 125 ...\n  ..$ fields.arts_entertainment_recreation_other_services: int [1:35] 150 75 75 350 500 35 250 125 1750 100 ...\n  ..$ fields.wholesale                                   : int [1:35] 100 20 450 35 400 15 50 150 900 20 ...\n $ facet_groups:'data.frame':   1 obs. of  2 variables:\n  ..$ name  : chr \"ward\"\n  ..$ facets:List of 1\n  .. ..$ :'data.frame': 35 obs. of  4 variables:\n  .. .. ..$ name : chr [1:35] \"Ashley\" \"Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston\" \"Bedminster\" \"Bishopston and Ashley Down\" ...\n  .. .. ..$ count: int [1:35] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n  .. .. ..$ state: chr [1:35] \"displayed\" \"displayed\" \"displayed\" \"displayed\" ...\n  .. .. ..$ path : chr [1:35] \"Ashley\" \"Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston\" \"Bedminster\" \"Bishopston and Ashley Down\" ...\n\n\nWell, it’s complicated. Looking on the above output of list() the object that looks most useful to us is the dat$records.\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the output of list(), why do you think is dat$records the most useful part of dat for us?\n\n\n\nAnd if you want to see how the dataframe dat$records looks like, the below function will show the first five rows.\n\nhead(dat$records)\n\n

Make sure to knit it as .html.\n\n\nIf this is to easy for you, why don’t you check the new Quarto format."

    "text": "This unit introduces students to the research fields of Urban Analytics and City Science. It enables them to utilise cutting-edge methods from these fields and pair them with new sources of data to answer urging research questions about cities. Moreover, the students will develop a critical understanding of these tools and data as well as their applicability and value for urban research, planning and urban policy making. Emphasis will be placed on the interactions between digital technologies and urban space and the smart city agenda.\nEmphasis will be placed on the network understanding of our cities. Networks have long formed a distinctive element of urban research. Various sub-fields of geography, such as transport, economic and urban geography, are heavily based on networks both from a conceptual and an analytical point of view. Moreover, the digital revolution and developments related to social media and connectivity as well as heightened flows of information within and between urban regions, have greatly enhanced the relevance of a network approach to contemporary socio-economic and cultural trends. This module will approach the above issues both from a theoretical and practical perspective.\nThe first part of this unit will be dedicated to concepts and tools from social network analysis, including hands-on practicals. This part will provide the fundamental knowledge of this module. Networks analysis will then lead to the concept of scaling in urban science, which will be linked with essential urban economic elements such as agglomeration economies and urban hierarchies. The practical knowledge of network analysis will be used as a stepping stone to understand ideas and methods from the field of transport geography regarding modelling flows within and between cities. Common thread here is the network structure which is an essential element of both transport geography and social network analysis. The empirical element of this part will deal with basic concepts such as gravity models as well as connectivity and accessibility measures.\nThe unit aims:"
