1.  [Cities, a very very brief introduction](src/why_cities.qmd){target="_blank"} **TODO: ADD SOME UNIT INFO**

    Why do cities exist? One cannot study, analyse and model cities and systems of cities
    unless they know their fundamental attributes, and the reasons why cities have 
    been developed at the first instance.

2.  [Smart cities, urban big data, digital twins and other buzz terms](src/smart_cities.qmd){target="_blank"}

    -   Practical: [APIs and urban data](src/apis.Rmd){target="_blank"}

    <!-- 2. digital traces **P**: ??? think of traces -->

    <!-- 3. Social Media **P**: Twitter -->
    
    How do digital technologies change cities? How does their usage actually enables
    citizens to act as sensors? And, how do these changes affect urban research? 
    We will first approach these issues from a theoretical perspective and then utilise
    such free and open urban data using APIs.

3.  [Networks: an introduction](src/intro_networks.qmd){target="_blank"}

    Networks are everywhere! After this lecture you will hopefully start seeing them.

4.  [Network analysis practical](src/network_analysis.Rmd){target="_blank"} **TODO: REMOVE SIM**

5.  [Network analysis practical](src/network_analysis.Rmd){target="_blank"} **TODO: REMOVE SIM**

    These two practical sessions will put into practise your newly acquired network
    understanding of cities.

6.  [Network science, urban laws and scaling](src/network_science.qmd){target="_blank"}

    -   Practical: [Build and compare models](src/network_models.Rmd){target="_blank"} **TODO decide if I need to describe sample\_ syntax**
    
    Moving from network analysis to network science with clear urban applications. 

7.  [Diversity in cities](src/diversity.qmd){target="_blank"}

    Why is diversity important in cities and how do we measure it?    

8.  Transport geography **TODO**

    Same methods, different facets of urban research. This part of the unit will allow
    you to apply your network skills to answer transport related questions. It will
    also make the transition from networks to flows.

<!-- For network analysis: - Barthelemy 2018 Ch. 7. It has examples for road and subway studies + some policy elements. No code. -->

<!-- use sfnetworks as it contains igraph. Use the vignettes. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sfnetworks/index.html -->

9.  Spatial interaction modelling **TODO**

    You learned to analyse network, now you can learn to analyse and model flows.
    Do you see the parallel?

10. Urban policies and causality **TODO**

    From urban analysis to urban policies. And how to assess such policies. Causality.
